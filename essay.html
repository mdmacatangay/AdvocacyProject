            <h4> Essay 1</h4>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">As the pandemic continues, many people suffer due to lack of jobs and resources. This situation has brought many challenges to every Filipinos and the impacts of these are hugely evident in our country. 
              An example would be lack of foods or other resources. An ordinary family wouldn’t be able to acquire their needs in a day, even if it means they work hard, if jobs are not available. 
              This led to Filipinos working together to build the community pantry. </p>
              
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">A community pantry helps the people who are needy or who are poor and need some help getting food. It was a heartwarming endeavor that received widespread support in Metro Manila. 
              It all started when a woman in Maginhawa, Quezon City, set up a bamboo cart where people could collect free food and other necessities, or give whatever food their families could spare. 
              Since then, other people were inspired by Ana Patricia Non and community pantries have arisen on street corners and sidewalks around Quezon City, Manila, Laguna, Batangas, and Rizal Province.</p>
              
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">In conclusion, this kind of act made us Filipinos help each other during our most hard and challenging days. 
              It gave us a higher sense of consideration to our fellow Filipinos. 
              This also served as an alarm to us that whenever such situations happen, it doesn’t hurt to help other people who are in need. And as time goes by, this would be also pass on to the next generation if we teach them how to care for others and be considerate. Change will happen if we work together and start today. Thank you.</p>

            <h4> Essay 2</h4>
            <br>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">Corruption and bad planning led to the reduction of public services and the slashing of community assets. These are the types of services that should be provided to our society's most vulnerable citizens. 
              The extension of the Covid-19 epidemic, as well as the inefficiency of certain government authorities, has had a significant impact on people's well-being. </p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">A small number of employees in many developing nations lose their employment and struggle to support themselves and their families. Serving the community necessitates the establishment of high-quality standards. 
              It must provide high-quality service provision and track progress toward obtaining excellent care for the people. Because government support is limited, many people turn to social services and other charitable individuals for assistance. 
              Community pantries grew in popularity in the Philippines as a result of the government's lack of long-term support and methodical planning. In other countries, food pantries serve vulnerable populations with high rates of chronic disease, making them an ideal setting for community-based health promotion programs. 
              While a pantry refers to a private or domestic room where food is stored, a community pantry refers to a place open to the public in the Philippines. It is a place where basic requirements such as food, sanitary basics, and medications are made available to the needy, allowing them to get resources at no cost. 
              The objective is to receive necessities from the community pantry's donated commodities. Simultaneously, persons who get food from the pantry may contribute something that they do not require to provide others with food and medication. The effort improves the community's mental health and well-being.</p>
            
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">During the Covid-19 epidemic, the community pantry project is critical to public health. It aids persons, particularly the poor, who are unable to obtain adequate food and medication. 
              It encourages people to work together by allowing them to contribute goods, produce, and other resources. It encourages local and private organizations, as well as individual residents, to collaborate for the greater good. 
              As a result, it builds, promotes, and mobilizes partnerships to fill up the gaps in addressing neighborhood public health challenges. Policies and mechanisms must be put in place to ensure the success of this project. 
              To mitigate the consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic, a demand for incorporating virtue ethics of compassion into public health has been made. In addition to ensuring the community pantries' long-term viability, ongoing care for others is essential. 
              Responding to the most basic needs of the most vulnerable individuals improves people's lives and closes inequities. ‘</p>
